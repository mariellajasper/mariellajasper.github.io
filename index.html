    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

                According to Adrian Pabst, the new British government has been honest about the bleak state of the economy, especially the UK's low productivity - this chart shows how productivity growth has slowed in the UK since the 2008 Financial Crisis.

                Similarly, Pabst claims there is a lack of government investment in the UK, however this chart shows UK government investment has been similar to other G7 governments.
